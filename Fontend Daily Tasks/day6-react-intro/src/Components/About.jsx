      <p>
        Hello! I'm Nikita Kanwar, a recent graduate in BCA. I'm passionate about
        frontend web development and love building beautiful, user-friendly
        websites using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm currently sharpening my
        skills and gaining hands-on experience through internship. Apart from
        tech , I enjoy creative writing and often express myself through poetry
        and blogs.
